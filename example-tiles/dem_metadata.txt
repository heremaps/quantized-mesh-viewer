  Description:
    Abstract: 
      Digitntains a series of
      elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the
      columns from west to east.  The DEM is formatted as one
      ASCII header record (A- record), followed by a series of profile
      records (B- records) each of which include a short B-record
      header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations per each
      profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy
      record (C-record).

      7.5-minute DEM (10- by 10-m data spacing, cast on Universal
      Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection).  Provides coverage in
      7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks.  Each product provides the same
      coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle without
      over edge.  

    Purpose: 
      DEM's can be used as source data for digital orthophotos, and, as
      layers in geographic information systems, for earth science
      analysis. DEM's can also serve as tools for volumetric analysis, for
      site location of towers, or for drainage basin delineation.  These
      data were collected as part of the National Mapping Program.

    Supplemental_Information: 
      7.5-minute DEMs have rows and columns which vary in length
      and are staggered. The UTM bounding coordinates form a
      quadrilateral (no two sides are parallel to each other), rather
      than a rectangle.  The user will need to pad out the uneven
      rows and columns with blanks or flagged data values, if a
      rectangle is required for the user's application.  Some software
      vendors have incorporated this function into their software
      for input of standard formatted USGS DEMs.

Data_Quality_Information


  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The accuracy of a DEM is dependent upon the level of
      detail of the source and the grid spacing used to sample
      that source. The primary limiting factor for the level of
      detail of the source is the scale of the source materials.
      The proper selection of grid spacing determines the level
      of content that may be extracted from a given source
      during digitization. 
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    The fidelity of the relationships encoded in the data
    structure of the DEM are automatically verified using
    a USGS software program upon completion of the data
    production cycle. The test verifies full compliance to the
    DEM specification.
  Completeness_Report:
    The DEM is visually inspected for completeness on a DEM view
    and edit system for the purpose of performing a final quality
    control and if necessary edit of the DEM. The physical format
    of each digital elevation model is validated for content
    completeness and logical consistency during production quality
    control and prior to archiving in the National Digital
    Cartographic Data Base.

    Due to the variable orientation of the quadrilateral in relation
    to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection grid,
    profiles that pass within the bounds of the DEM quadrilateral,
    may be void of elevation grid points, and are not represented
    in the DEM. This condition occurs infrequently and is always the
    first or last profile of the dataset.

    Level 2 DEM: Level 2 DEM's may contain void areas due to
    interruptions to contours in the source graphic or DLG. Void
    area elevation grid posts are assigned the value of -32,767. In
    addition, suspect elevation areas may exist in the DEM but are
    not specifically identified. Suspect areas can be located on the
    source graphic as a "disturbed surface, " symbolized by
    contours overprinted with photorevised or other surface
    patterns.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: 
        The horizontal accuracy of the DEM is expressed
        as an estimated root mean square error (RMSE).
        The estimate of the RMSE is based upon
        horizontal accuracy tests of the DEM source
        materials which are selected as equal to or less
        than intended horizontal RMSE error of the DEM.
        The testing of horizontal accuracy of the source
        materials isaccomplished by comparing the
        planimetric (X and Y) coordinates of well-defined
        ground points with the coordinates of the same
        points as determined from a source of higher
        accuracy.
      Quantitative_Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Assessment:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Value:   RMSE of the DEM. 
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Explanation:
          Digital elevation models meet horizontal National Map 
          Accuracy Standards (NMAS) accuracy requirements.
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The vertical RMSE statistic is used to describe the
        vertical accuracy of a DEM, encompassing both
        random and systematic errors introduced during
        production of the data. The RMSE is encoded in
        element number 5 of record C of the DEM. 
        Accuracy is computed by a comparison of linear
        interpolated elevations in the DEM with
        corresponding known elevations. Test points are
        well distributed, representative of the terrain, and
        have true elevations with accuracies well within
        the DEM accuracy criteria.  Acceptable test points
        include, in order of preference: field control,
        aerotriangulated test points, spot elevations, or
        points on contours from existing source maps
        with appropriate contour interval.  A minimum of
        28 test points per DEM is required to compute the
        RMSE, which is composed of a single test using 20
        interior points and 8 edge points. Edge points are
        those which are located along, at, or near the
        quadrangle neatlines and are deemed by the
        editor to be useful to evaluating the accuracy of
        the edge of the DEM. Collection of test point data
        and comparison of the DEM with the quadrangle
        hypsography are conducted by the quality control
        units within the USGS. 

        There are three types of DEM vertical errors;
        blunder, systematic and random.  These errors
        are reduced in magnitude by editing but cannot be
        completely eliminated. Blunder errors are those
        errors of major proportions and are easily
        identified and removed during interactive editing.
        Systematic errors are those errors that follow
        some fixed pattern and are introduced by data
        collection procedures and systems. These error
        artifacts include: vertical elevation shifts,
        misinterpretation of terrain surface due to trees,
        buildings and shadows, and fictitious ridges, tops,
        benches or striations.  Random errors result from
        unknown or accidental causes.

        DEM's are edited to correctly depict elevation
        surfaces that correspond to water bodies of 
        specified size.

        Level 2 DEM:  A vertical RMSE of one-half of the
        contour interval, determined by the source map,
        is the maximum permitted.  Systematic errors
        may not exceed one contour interval,
        determined by the source map, is the maximum
        permitted.  Systematic errors may not exceed
        one contour interval specified by the source
        graphic.  Level 2 DEMs have been processed or
        smoothed for consistency and edited to remove
        identifiable systematic errors.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Level 2 DEM: Level 2 DEM's are produced by
        converting 1:24,000-scale and 1:100,000-scale
        hypsography digital line graph (DLG) data to DEM
        format or the DEM's are generated from vector
        data derived from scanned raster files of USGS
        1:24.000-scale or 1:100,000-scale map series
        contour separates.

        Level 3 DEM: Level 3 DEM's are created from DLG
        data that has been vertically integrated with all
        categories of hypsography, hydrography, ridge
        line, break line, drain files and all vertical and
        horizontal control networks. The production of
        level 3 DEMs requires a system of logic
        incorporated into the software interpolation
        algorithms that clearly differentiates and
        correctly interpolates between the various types
        of terrain, data densities and data distribution.

        Water body editing: DEM surface areas
        corresponding to water bodies are flattened and
        assigned map specified or estimated surface
        elevations.  Water body areas are defined as
        ponds, lakes, and reservoirs that exceed 0.5
        inches at map scale and double line drainage that
        exceeds 0.25 inches at map scale. Water body
        shorelines are derived either from a hypsographic
        DLG or by interactive delineation from 1:24,000-
        scale or 1:100,000-scale USGS map series.

        Edge matching and edge joining:  DEM datasets
        within a project area (consisting of a number of
        adjacent files) are edge match and edge join
        edited to assure terrain surface continuity
        between files.  Edge matching is the process of
        averaging adjacent elevation values along
        common edges within a zone of approximately 5
        row or column grid posts on both edges. When
        edge values exceed 3 elevation units difference,
        edge joining is performed.  Edge joining is an
        extensive level of editing and requires editing
        elevation values internal to the DEM in order to
        create more accurate terrain representations by
        correcting the alignment of ridges and drains, and
        overall topographic shaping within an
        approximately 25-30 row or column grid post
        zone on both edges.

        Quality control:  DEM's are viewed on interactive
        editing systems to identify and correct blunder
        and systematic errors.  DEM's are verified for
        physical format and logical consistency at the
        production centers and before archiving in the
        National Digital Cartographic Data Base (NDCDB)
        utilizing the Digital Elevation Model Verification
        System (DVS) software.
