Conventions for git usage:
--------------------------
- Development should happen on features branches. Never commit to master directly.
- Branch names should be `lowercase-minus-separated.author-nickname`.
- Submit pull request to get stuff merged to master.
- Commit messages should be single-line.
- Never merge master to feature branches.
