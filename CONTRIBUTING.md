Conventions for git usage:
--------------------------
- Development should happen on a features branches. Never commit to master directly.
- Branch names should be `kebab-case.author-nickname`.
- Commit messages should contain one-line title and optional description after the first line.
- Never merge master to a feature branch, rebase instead.
- Submit pull request to get stuff merged to master.
