# Contributing to quantized-mesh-viewer

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document outlines how we expect
contributions to happen.

## Git

- Development should happen on feature branches. Never commit to master directly.
- Branch names should be `kebab-case.author-nickname`.
- Commit messages should contain one-line title and optional description after the first line.
- Never merge master to a feature branch, rebase instead.
- Submit pull request to get stuff merged to master.
